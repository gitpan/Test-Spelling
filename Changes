Revision history for Test-Spelling

0.12  2011-04-25
        - Best Practical has taken over maintainership of this module
        - Try various spellcheck programs instead of hardcoding the ancient
          `spell` [rt.cpan.org #56483] (reported by Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ, et al)
        - Remove temporary files more aggressively [rt.cpan.org #41586]
          (reported by Tokuhiro Matsuno)
          - fixed by not creating them at all :) instead we now use IPC::Open3
        - Remove suggestion to use broken `aspell -l` [rt.cpan.org #28967]
          (reported by David Hand)
        - Add set_pod_file_filter for skipping translations, etc.
          [rt.cpan.org #63755] (reported by me :))
        - Skip tests in all_pod_files_spelling_ok if there is no working
          spellchecker
        - Provide a has_working_spellchecker so you can skip your own tests if
          there's no working spellchecker
        - Switch to Module::Install
        - Rewrite and modernize a lot of the documentation
        - Decruftify code, such as by using Exporter and lexical filehandles
        - Support .plx files (you're welcome Schwern)

        - Some documentation fixes.
        - Added note about per-file stopwords by Chris Dolan.
        - Use a temporary file instead of open2() to solve win32 portability
          issues. (Thanks to Chris Laco!)
