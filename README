Test::Spelling version 0.11
===========================

    "Test::Spelling" lets you check the spelling of a POD file, and report
    its results in standard "Test::Simple" fashion. This module requires the
    spell program.

        use Test::More;
        use Test::Spelling;
        plan tests => $num_tests;
        pod_file_spelling_ok( $file, "POD file spelling OK" );

    Module authors can include the following in a t/pod_spell.t file and
    have "Test::Spelling" automatically find and check all POD files in a
    module distribution:

        use Test::More;
        use Test::Spelling;
        all_pod_files_spelling_ok();

    Note, however that it is not really recommended to include this test
    with a CPAN distribution, or a package that will run in an uncontrolled
    environment, because there's no way of predicting if spell will be
    available or the wordlist used will give the same results (what if it's
    in a different language, for example?).

    You can add your own stopwords (words that should be ignored by the
    spell check):

        add_stopwords(qw(adsf thiswordiscorrect));

    These stopwords are global for the test. See L<Pod::Spell> for a variety of
    ways to add per-file stopwords to each .pm file.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.10
        - Some documentation fixes.
        - Added note about per-file stopwords by Chris Dolan.
        - Use a temporary file instead of open2() to solve win32 portability
          issues. (Thanks to Chris Laco!)
